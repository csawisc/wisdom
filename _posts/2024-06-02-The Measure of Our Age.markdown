### Abstract
Between 1900 and 2000, Americans gained 30 years of life on average. But we've invested much more in lengthening lives than in living those long lives well. This focus on quantity over quality creates challenges - in care, housing, and financial security - for those facing aging themselves and for those who love them.  40 million family caregivers already help older relatives for "free", but with costs to themselves in time, money, jobs, and health. There is potential for purpose in late life that too often goes unrealized.
