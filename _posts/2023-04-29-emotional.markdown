### Abstract
How can you connect better with others? How you make sense of your frustrations, fear and anxiety? What ccan you do to live a happier life? The answer is understanding your  emotions. Feeling is every bit as important as thinking.
We were taught to surpress emotions, but we cannot "not feel". Feelings are part of being human and of interacting with other humans. 
Part 1: describes our current knowledge of how emotions evolved and why.
Part 2: look into the central role of emotion in human pleasure, motivation, insipiration and determination.
Part 3: explore emotional profile and emotion regulation.

We now know emotion is profoundly integrated into the neural circuts of our brains, inseparable from our circuits for "rational" thoughts. We could live without the ability to reason, but we would be completely dysfunctional if we couldn't feel. Emotion is a part of the mental machinery we share with all higher animals, but even more than rationality its role in our behavior is what sets us apart from them.
