### Fairfax County Library: 305.26 Connoll 2023
### Author: M.T. Connoll (Department of Justice's Elder Justice Initiative Act)

### Abstract
Between 1900 and 2000, Americans gained 30 years of life on average. But we've invested much more in lengthening lives than in living those long lives well. This focus on quantity over quality creates challenges - in care, housing, and financial security - for those facing aging themselves and for those who love them.  40 million family caregivers already help older relatives for "free", but with costs to themselves in time, money, jobs, and health. There is potential for purpose in late life that too often goes unrealized.

  The book ends with the following resounding ask --- "We may never want the kind of immortaility that requires becoming one with our computers. But for the first time in history, we have the chance to have the memories of all of our lives live on indefinitely after us, to leave wakes in time as great as those once made only by kings. But it will only happen if we don't forget to remember, to protect the record of our time in this world, and most of all, to find new, more enduring ways to preserve our memories.  Memory is the guardian of all things. But in the end, we are the guardians of memory".
