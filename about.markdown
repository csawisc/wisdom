  * Introducing INVESTIGATOR: examine Value, Ethics, and Safety Issues in Giant AI models through online crowdsoursing. If you find some large AI models problematic from Ethics and Safety point of view, let us know through the INVESTIGATOR, and we will let others know. If you find them behave ethically, also let us know so that other Large language models can learn from them! And please also see what others have found for these large AI models that may need a CHANGE!
